        Your privacy is critically important to us. Propaganda Solutions Global
        Limited respects your privacy regarding any information we may collect
        while operating our website, www.mx2.ai. This Privacy Policy applies to

      </p>
      <TermsItem title="Website Visitors">
        <p>
          Like most website operators, we collect non-personally-identifying
          information such as browser type, language preference, referring site,
          and the date and time of each visitor request. This helps us
          understand how visitors use our website. We may release
          non-personally-identifying information in aggregate, e.g., by
          publishing a report on usage trends.
        </p>
      </TermsItem>
      <TermsItem title="Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information">
        <p>
          Certain visitors choose to interact with us in ways that require us to
          gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
          information depends on the nature of the interaction, such as signing
          up for a newsletter requiring a username and email address.
        </p>
      </TermsItem>
      <TermsItem title=" Security">
        <p>
          We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
          personal information, but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>
      </TermsItem>
      <TermsItem title="Advertisements">
        <p>
          Ads on our website may use cookies to gather information for targeted
          advertising. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by us and

      >
        <p>
          We disclose potentially personally-identifying and
          personally-identifying information only to those of our employees,
          contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
          information to process it on our behalf or to provide services
          available at our website, and (ii) have agreed not to disclose it to
          others. Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated
          organizations may be located outside your home country; by using our
          website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. We
          will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
          personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to our
          employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described
          above, we disclose potentially personally-identifying and
          personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena,
          court order, or other governmental requests, or when we believe in
          good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our
          property or rights, third parties, or the public at large.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a registered user and have supplied your email address, we
          may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features,
          solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date with what’s going on
          with us and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate
          this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a
          minimum.
